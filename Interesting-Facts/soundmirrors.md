## Sound Mirrors
### Author - CJ (Linux Gamer)
Sound Mirrors are large concrete structures designed as an early warning system for Britain to detect enemy aircraft.
Sound mirrors worked by focusing the sound from a plane's engine so it could be heard before it was visible to the human eye. 
There were three designs of the Sound Mirrors, 20ft, 30ft and 200ft. All three are present on a part of the RSPB Nature Reserve in Romney Marsh, South-east England.

#### How it worked
The Sound Mirrors worked by using their curver surface to concentrate sound waves by capturing the noise of incoming aircraft approaching from the European mainland and focus it onto a microphone or a human listener equipped with then state-of-the-art stethoscopes.
