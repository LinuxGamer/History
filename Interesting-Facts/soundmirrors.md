## Sound Mirrors

### Author - CJ (Linux Gamer)

Sound Mirrors are large concrete structures designed as an early warning system for Britain to detect enemy aircraft.
Sound mirrors worked by focusing the sound from a plane's engine so it could be heard before it was visible to the human eye. 
There were three designs of the Sound Mirrors, 20ft, 30ft and 200ft. All three are present on a part of the RSPB Nature Reserve in Romney Marsh, South-east England.

#### How it worked

The Sound Mirrors worked by using their curver surface to concentrate sound waves by capturing the noise of incoming aircraft approaching from the European mainland and focus it onto a microphone or a human listener equipped with then state-of-the-art stethoscopes.

#### Why?

Sound Mirrors are the ancestors to radar, and so the point to them is practically the same. They are used to notice and located where enemy aircraft are.

They do this by being a giant curved surface.The sound waves reach the concrete walls and bounce off them into the microphones that are in front. The operator can then identify which direction the aircraft is and can relay the information to RAF Fighter Command.

#### Why Are They Not Used Now?

They started to become obsolete with the invention of faster aircraft and it became hard for operators to distinguish between aircraft and seagoing vessels. And with the invention of radar in 1932 it was never used in an active conflict situation.e
