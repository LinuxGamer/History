# World War II
## The Beginning

### Authors Notes
I have been interested in World War II, since I was a young boy. Specifically in the RAF; having a keen interest in aircraft as well. I have visited many a museuem and had a fasination in all of the stories behind the WW2 aircraft. Never having had a keen interest in history as a whole, I never did anything with it, just kept it in my head, kept these interests hidden, but now I can share them. And HOPEFULLY, you will enjoy reading this as much as I have writing it.

### _The Outbreak of War_
#### _September 1939_
In early 1939, Adolf Hitler (the German dictator) was resolute about invading and occupying Poland. Poland had an agreement with French and British military for support, were it to be attacked by German forces. Secret negotiations on August 23-24 between the Soviet Union and Germany ended in an agreement (named the German-Soviet Non-aggression Pact) signed in Moscow. In a secret protocol of the pact, the two countries agreed that Poland should be divided between them, (the Western third going to Germany, the Eastern two-thirds going to the U.S.S.R.)

Even though this pact had been signed, Hitler wanted Poland all for Germany, so he gave orders to start an invasion on August 26. However, with the signing of a formal treaty of mutual assistance between Great Britain and Poland caused him to postpone the hostilities for a few days. Finally, at 12:40pm on 31st August 1939, Hitler gave the order for hostilities against Poland to start at 4:45 the next morning. The invasion began as ordered; in response, Great Britain and Frace declared war on September 3, at 11am and 5pm, respectively. It was at that point that World War II had begun.
