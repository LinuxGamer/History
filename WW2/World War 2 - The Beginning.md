# World War II
## The Beginning

### Introduction
World War II or the Second World War was an International conflict principally between the Axis powers - Germany, Italy, and Japan - and the Allied powers - France, Britain, America, the Soviet Union, and China; and lasting between 1939-1945.

### The Outbreak of War
#### September 1939
In early 1939, Adolf Hitler (the German dictator) was resolute about invading and occupying Poland. Poland had an agreement with French and British military for support, were it to be attacked by German forces. Secret negotiations on August 23-24 between the Soviet Union and Germany ended in an agreement (named the German-Soviet Non-aggression Pact) signed in Moscow. In a secret protocol of the pact, the two countries agreed that Poland should be divided between them, (the Western third going to Germany, the Eastern two-thirds going to the U.S.S.R.)

Even though this pact had been signed, Hitler wanted Poland all for Germany, so he gave orders to start an invasion on August 26. However, with the signing of a formal treaty of mutual assistance between Great Britain and Poland caused him to postpone the hostilities for a few days. Finally, at 12:40pm on 31st August 1939, Hitler gave the order for hostilities against Poland to start at 4:45 the next morning.
